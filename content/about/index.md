## My Background

I am a Masters student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. My research is on improving generalizability of lightweight object detectors so that they perform as well as high-capacity models without sacrificing speed and efficiency.

## My Experience

I have almost an year of experience in building and optimizing computer vision models and applications for production.

### Computer Vision Expert @ Innotec Solutions (July 2023 - August 2023)

A CCTV service provider where I primarily offered consultancy services.

- Trained employee to perform data curation, labeling using CVAT, and model training using AWS EC2 and YOLO.
- Provided expert advice on model training and deployment queries, enabling them to build in-house video analytics solutions.

### Computer Vision Intern @ Tapway (Jan 2022 - Sep 2022)

An AI startup where I worked on projects from high-profile clients such as PLUS, RTS, KLK and others which are now deployed to production.
 
**Python Development**

- Developed an efficient inference pipeline to detect and track anomalous objects with ~90% accuracy.
- Implemented intelligent runtime ROI adjustment to tackle continuous variations in ROI, improving counting accuracy by ~20%.

**Model Inference Optimization**

- Decreased CPU usage of server-side inference by 40%, improving multi-stream inference performance.
- Fixed a major memory leak bug in the inference pipeline that was causing 5-10% degradation in performance.
