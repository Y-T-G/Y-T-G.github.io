## My Background

I am a Masters student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. My research is about improving generalizability of lightweight object detectors so that they perform accurate detection without the overhead of larger models that achieve similar performance at a higher cost.

## My Experience

I have an year long experience in building and optimizing computer vision models and applications in a corporate setting.

### Computer Vision Expert @ Innotec Solutions (July 2023 - Present)

A CCTV service provider where I primarily offered consultancy services.

- Trained employee on data curation, labeling and model training using CVAT, AWS EC2 and YOLO.
- Assisted in developing and improving accuracy of detection models.
- Provided expert advice on model training and deployment queries.

### Computer Vision Intern @ Tapway (Jan 2022 - Oct 2022)

An AI startup where I worked on projects from high-profile clients such as PLUS, RTS, KLK and others which are now deployed to production.

**Model training**

- Performed data curation and labeling for 1000s of images.
- Trained segmentation and object detection models for realtime defect detection and vehicle classification along with license plate OCR.
 

**Python Development**

- Developed inference pipeline to count no. of objects passing on a conveyor.
- Integrated Kalman filter in centroid tracker to improve object tracking and counting accuracy.
- Developed inference pipeline to count the no. of items being loaded onto a tractor.
- Utilized OpenCV to implement a background subtraction logic to dynamically adjust region-of-interest.
- Modified existing AWS Lambda to send error notifications to Slack.


**Model Inference Optimization**

- Decreased CPU usage of server-side inference by 40%.
- Fixed a major memory leak bug in the inference pipeline that was causing performance degradation and reduction in accuracy.


**Support/Troubleshooting**

- Setup Jetson TX2 servers for inference code deployment.
- Assisted in Root Cause Analysis of bugs in the inference pipeline.
