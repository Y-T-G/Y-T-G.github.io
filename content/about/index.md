## My Background

I am a Masters student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, researching active learning for object detectors.

## My Experience

I have been in the video analytics industry for over a year, building and optimizing computer vision models and pipelines for production.

### Algorithm Engineer (Computer Vision) @ Graymatics (Sep 2023 - Present)

- Implemented batched inference and dynamic frame skipping in DeepStream to optimize inference serverâ€™s GPU utilization and memory usage, improving FPS for real-time analytics involving 140+ cameras.
- Created a lightweight skeleton-based action recognition architecture, lowering false positives by up to 500%.
- Developed an efficient inference pipeline for crowd analytics, enabling edge inference on NVIDIA Jetson.

### Computer Vision Consultant @ Innotec Solutions (Jul 2023 - Aug 2023)

- Provided expert advice on model training and deployment queries, enabling them to build in-house video analytics solutions.

### Computer Vision Intern @ Tapway (Jan 2022 - Sep 2022)

An AI startup where I worked on projects from high-profile clients such as PLUS, RTS, KLK and others which are now deployed to production.
 
**Python Development**

- Developed an efficient inference pipeline to detect and track anomalous objects with ~90% accuracy.
- Implemented intelligent runtime ROI adjustment to tackle continuous variations in ROI, improving counting accuracy.

**Model Inference Optimization**

- Reduced resource starvation and latency spikes in multi-stream inference by optimizing the number of threads spawned by each process.
- Fixed a major memory leak in the inference pipeline that was causing noticeable degradation in performance.
