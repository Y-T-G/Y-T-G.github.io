## My Background

A computer vision enthusiast who spends too much time answering questions on the internet.

## My Experience

I've worked in the video analytics industry for over two years, building and optimizing computer vision models and pipelines for production.

### Community Moderator @ Ultralytics (Aug 2024 - Present)
- Responded to {{< github-issues >}} issues on GitHub, and addressed hundreds of other queries from the community on Discord,
Reddit and Forums.
- Contributed {{< github-pr >}} PRs to address bugs, fix documentation issues, and improve overall user experience.

### Algorithm Engineer (Computer Vision) @ Graymatics (Sep 2023 - Aug 2024)

- Implemented batching and motion-based frame skipping in DeepStream to optimize inference serverâ€™s GPU utilization and memory usage, improving FPS for real-time analytics involving 140+ cameras.
- Created a lightweight skeleton-based action recognition architecture, achieving ~90% accuracy at 500+ FPS.
- Resolved a critical bug affecting server stability and improved multi-GPU load distribution to achieve an inference throughput of upto 300 streams per server.

### Computer Vision Consultant @ Innotec Solutions (Jul 2023 - Aug 2023)

- Provided expert advice on model training and deployment queries, enabling them to build in-house video analytics solutions.

### Computer Vision Intern @ Tapway (Jan 2022 - Sep 2022)

- Developed an efficient inference pipeline to detect and track anomalous objects with ~90% accuracy.
- Implemented intelligent runtime ROI adjustment to tackle continuous variations in ROI, improving counting accuracy.
- Reduced resource starvation and latency spikes in multi-stream inference by optimizing the number of threads spawned by each process.
- Fixed a major memory leak in the inference pipeline that was causing noticeable degradation in performance.
