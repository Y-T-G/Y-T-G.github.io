## My Background

I am a Masters student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. My Masters research is on improving generalizability of lightweight object detectors so that they perform as well as high-capacity models without sacrificing speed and efficiency.

## My Experience

I have almost an year of experience in building and optimizing computer vision models and applications for production.

### Computer Vision Expert @ Innotec Solutions (July 2023 - Present)

A CCTV service provider where I primarily offered consultancy services.

- Trained employee to perform data curation, labeling using CVAT, and model training using AWS EC2 and YOLO.
- Assisted in developing and improving accuracy of detection models.
- Provided expert advice on model training and deployment queries.

### Computer Vision Intern @ Tapway (Jan 2022 - Sep 2022)

An AI startup where I worked on projects from high-profile clients such as PLUS, RTS, KLK and others which are now deployed to production.

**Model training**

- Performed data curation and labeling for 1000s of images.
- Trained segmentation and object detection models for realtime defect detection and vehicle classification along with license plate OCR.
 
**Python Development**

- Developed inference pipeline to count no. of objects.
- Integrated Kalman filter in centroid tracker to improve object tracking and counting accuracy.
- Utilized OpenCV to implement intelligent inference ROI adjustment.

**Model Inference Optimization**

- Decreased CPU usage of server-side inference by 40%, improving multi-stream inference performance.
- Fixed a major memory leak bug in the inference pipeline that was causing performance degradation and reduction in accuracy.

**Support/Troubleshooting**

- Setup Jetson TX2 servers for inference code deployment.
- Assisted in Root Cause Analysis of bugs.
